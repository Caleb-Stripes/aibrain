Hark! Attend, good gentle reader, to a merry tale of woe and wit.
Wherefore doth the muffin sport a feathered coat, and why doth the spoon
declare itself a knight, most valiant in the buttery moat?  Fie on seriousness!

Marry, the ale doth laugh and the candle curtseys to the plate;
the cheese, being round and full of jocund secrets, doth whisper gossip
of misplaced socks and crowns made of stale biscuit.  O rare sport!

So take thy quill, and with a grin that outshines the morning sun,
let foolishness and gentle mockery keep company with thy hours.
Thus we live and jest, until the rooster calls us back to sense.

But soft! What light from yonder pantry breaks? 'Tis the ham, and Juliet is
its name — a rose by any other dinnerware would smell as savory.  Lo, the
porridge doth rehearse a sonnet to the moon, and the cods in their boots do
perform a masque beneath the tablecloth.  Verily, the cucumber laments
its station whilst the mustard boasts of noble tang.

When knaves of appetite do parley with the noble fork, disputes arise
of etiquette and crumbs; yet all is settled by a court of crackers and
a wise old teacup who speaketh in riddles and pours counsel like chamomile.

Anon, a minstrel breadstick struts forth, singing of lost mittens and
adventures in the larder where the jam doth conspire with the pepper.
The audience of spoons applaud with spoons; the sugar pot giggles, and
even the stern salt permits a smile to cross his briny cheek.

Thus the kitchen theatre reigns till candle-snuff and yawning night,
when every plate retires to dream of feasts yet unmade and breakfasts
to come.  Go hence and keep thy wits as light as pastry, and mind the
butter — for where mirth abounds, calamity takes a holiday.
